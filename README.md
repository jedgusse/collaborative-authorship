# De Gussem, Jeroen. ‘Collaborative Authorship in Twelfth-Century Latin Literature. A Stylometric Approach to Gender, Synergy and Authority'. Ghent University and University of Antwerp, 2019.

This GitHub repository contains the text data and accompanying Python code used in the PhD thesis ‘Collaborative Authorship in Twelfth-Century Latin Literature. A Stylometric Approach to Gender, Synergy and Authority', to be defended at Ghent University and the University of Antwerp in October 2019.
The rationale behind this page is to allow for the replication of experiments conducted throughout this thesis's chapters.
Yet, the original texts have been slightly camouflaged so as to respect the copyright laws protecting the editions. 
Only function words, which are highly successful for distinguishing writing styles— were retained in their original position and form.
All the remaining, content-loaded words, were substituted by ‘dummy words', rendering the text illegible. 
This means that some experiments in this thesis, those which relied on most-frequent content words in addition to function words, will not be replicable by relying solely on the text data as available on GitHub. 
To replicate these experiments, one may request access to the electronic versions of the editions referred to by contacting [Brepols Library of Latin Texts](http://clt.brepolis.net/llta/).

# Data

Aside from a number of exceptions, the pool of texts used for the experiments carried out in the thesis roughly derive from two main databases. 

## Brepols Library of Latin Texts

The first is the Brepols Library of Latin Texts (LLT).
The LLT first and foremost contains all the editions from Brepols's own *Corpus Christianorum*, in addition to several external critical editions that comply to modern critical standards.
Aside from being able to rely on the texts that had previously been collected in LLT, I have been fortunate to collaborate with Brepols on the further digitization of texts which had thusfar not been available in electronic edition, such as Ewald Könsgen's edition of the *Epistolae duorum amantium* (1974), Suger of Saint-Denis's collected oeuvre as edited by Françoise Gasparri (1996–2001), or the respective works by Elisabeth and Ekbert of Schönau in the edition by Ferdinand W. Roth (1884).

## *Patrologia Latina*

For the remaining texts, I chiefly relied on the digitized version of the *Patrologia Latina* (*PL*), which has become electronically available since 1993, and has remained one of the most sizeable Latin corpora online (±113 million words).
