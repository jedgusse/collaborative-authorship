This GitHub repository contains the text data and accompanying Python code used in the thesis ‘Collaborative Authorship in Twelfth-Century Latin Literature. A Stylometric Approach to Gender, Synergy and Authority’, to be defended at Ghent University and the University of Antwerp in October 2019.
The rationale behind this page is to allow for the replication of experiments conducted in the pages of this thesis.
Yet, the original texts have been slightly camouflaged so as to respect the copyright laws protecting the editions. 
Only function words, which are highly successful for distinguishing writing styles— were retained in their original position and form. 
All the remaining, content-loaded words, were substituted by ‘dummy words’, rendering the text illegible. 
This means that some experiments in this thesis, those which relied on most-frequent content words in addition to function words, will not be replicable by relying solely on the text data as available on GitHub. 
To replicate these experiments, one may request access to the electronic versions of the editions referred to by contacting [Brepols Library of Latin Texts](http://clt.brepolis.net/llta/).
